--------------
-- Save ideal in text file with msolve format.
--
-- The saved file will need post processing to remove underscores.
-- In VSCodium this can be done searching for the regex: _\((\d),(\d)\) and replacing it with $1$2.
--
-- Two other things need to be removed from the saved file (manually):
-- -- the parenthesis { and } that hold the variables of the first line, and
-- -- the comma after the last generator.
